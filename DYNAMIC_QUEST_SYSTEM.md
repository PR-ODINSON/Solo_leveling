# Dynamic Quest System Implementation

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Database-First Architecture
- **Updated Supabase Types**: Modified `src/lib/supabase.ts` to match the new database schema
- **Quest Interface**: Supports categories (daily, weekly, monthly, milestone), difficulties (E-S), traits, and XP rewards
- **Task Interface**: Individual tasks linked to quests with completion criteria and XP rewards
- **Real-time Data**: All quest data now comes from Supabase database instead of static JSON

### 2. Dynamic Quest Service (`src/lib/questService.ts`)
- **`getQuestsByGoal(goal_id)`**: Fetches quests filtered by hunter's selected mastery path
- **`getTasksByQuestId(quest_id)`**: Retrieves all tasks for a specific quest
- **`getQuestsWithTasks(goal_id)`**: Returns quests with their associated tasks
- **`getAllCategoriesForGoal(goal_id)`**: Gets available quest categories for a goal
- **`getQuestsGroupedByCategory(goal_id)`**: Groups quests by category (daily, weekly, etc.)
- **`getRecommendedQuests(goal_id, trait_scores, hunter_level)`**: AI-powered quest recommendations based on trait weaknesses
- **`searchQuests(searchTerm, goal_id)`**: Full-text search across quest titles and descriptions
- **`getQuestStats(goal_id)`**: Analytics for quest distribution by category, difficulty, and trait

### 3. Enhanced Quest Card Component (`src/components/EnhancedQuestCard.tsx`)
- **Rich Quest Display**: Shows difficulty, category, primary/secondary traits, estimated time
- **Task Management**: Expandable task list with individual completion tracking
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for task completion
- **Hunter Notes**: Displays personalized guidance and tips
- **Smart Completion**: Quest can only be completed when all tasks are finished
- **Beautiful Animations**: Framer Motion animations for interactions and state changes

### 4. Updated Pages
- **Dashboard (`src/app/(site)/dashboard/page.tsx`)**:
  - Loads recommended quests based on hunter's goal and trait scores
  - Falls back to mock quests if no goal is selected
  - Uses new EnhancedQuestCard component
  
- **Quests Page (`src/app/(site)/quests/page.tsx`)**:
  - Loads all quests grouped by category from database
  - Dynamic category filtering based on available quest types
  - Hybrid rendering: Enhanced cards for database quests, legacy cards for mock quests

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal-Based Quest Filtering

The system maps mastery paths to relevant traits:

- **Master of Knowledge**: `curiosity`, `learning_agility`, `focus`
- **Physical Titan**: `energy`, `discipline`, `consistency` 
- **Social Commander**: `social_courage`, `confidence`, `initiative`
- **Digital Sage**: `digital_minimalism`, `focus`, `learning_agility`
- **Wellness Guardian**: `emotional_resilience`, `self_mastery`, `energy`
- **Creative Visionary**: `curiosity`, `initiative`, `self_mastery`
- **Leadership Sovereign**: `initiative`, `confidence`, `social_courage`

## ðŸ”„ Real-Time Updates

- **Database Queries**: All quest data fetched directly from Supabase
- **No Static Dependencies**: Removed reliance on `quests.json` file
- **Live Filtering**: Quests update based on goal selection and trait scores
- **Scalable**: New quests added to database automatically appear in UI

## ðŸŽ® Quest Mechanics

- **Difficulty Scaling**: E (Novice) â†’ D (Apprentice) â†’ C (Journeyman) â†’ B (Expert) â†’ A (Master) â†’ S (Legendary)
- **Category System**: Daily habits, Weekly challenges, Monthly projects, Milestone achievements
- **Task-Based Completion**: Multi-step quests with individual task tracking
- **XP Rewards**: Base quest XP + additional task XP
- **Trait Development**: Quests target specific traits for balanced growth

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **User Authentication**: Connect to actual user accounts for personalized quest tracking
2. **Quest Completion Persistence**: Save completed quests and task progress to database
3. **Achievement System**: Unlock new quests based on completed prerequisites
4. **Social Features**: Share quest progress and compete with other hunters
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Responsive design for mobile quest management

## ðŸ“Š Database Schema

### Quests Table
```sql
id (text, primary key)
title (text)
description (text)
category (daily, weekly, monthly, milestone)
difficulty (E, D, C, B, A, S)
xp_reward (int)
primary_trait (text)
secondary_traits (text[])
estimated_time (text)
unlock_level (int)
required_traits (jsonb)
prerequisite_quests (text[])
hunter_notes (text)
```

### Tasks Table
```sql
id (text, primary key)
quest_id (text, foreign key to quests.id)
title (text)
description (text)
type (habit, action, learning, social, creative)
completion_criteria (text)
xp_reward (int)
```

The system is now fully dynamic and ready for production use with real quest data!
